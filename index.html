            <p> Howdy! Im Stephanie Reyes and I live in the great big state of Texas! I love spending time with my family and loved ones, I enjoy going to the lake, as well as boxing in my free time. I am in school with the end goal of obtaining a bachelors in Software Development and began taking courses in computer science when I was 16. I truly enjoy learning programming and cannot wait to learn more in this course</p>
